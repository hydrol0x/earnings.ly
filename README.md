### How it works
Earnings.ly takes the pain out of sifting through hundreds of pages of earnings calls. Instead, it will automatically query the correct SEC report and then analyze it using NLP models to return a response that is appropriate to the user's question. 
Now, you can chat with Earnings.ly about a company's outlook just as you would speak with a financial analyst.
